    text: "As Built scanning and 3D modelling for Petrochemical, Oil and gas plants",
    details:
      "As-built scanning and 3D modeling are two interconnected processes that have significantly transformed the way construction and engineering projects are executed and managed.As-built scanning, also known as reality capture or laser scanning, involves using advanced scanning technologies, such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) or photogrammetry, to capture precise and detailed measurements of existing structures and environments. By scanning the physical space, the technology creates a digital representation of the as-built conditions, including buildings, infrastructure, and landscapes.The data collected through as-built scanning serves as the foundation for 3D modeling. 3D modeling is the process of creating a three-dimensional digital representation of objects or spaces using specialized software. By utilizing the scanned data, accurate and realistic virtual models can be constructed, replicating the physical environment with high precision.",

    text: "Reverse engineering for mechanical parts",
    details:
      "The primary objective of reverse engineering is to understand the design, dimensions, and functionality of a mechanical part that may lack proper documentation or digital models. This process is commonly used when the original drawings or specifications are not available or when modifications or improvements to an existing part are necessary.Reverse engineering begins with the acquisition of data from the physical part. This can be done through various methods, such as 3D scanning, coordinate measuring machines (CMM), or manual measurements. 3D scanning techniques, including laser scanning or structured light scanning, are often preferred as they provide accurate and detailed geometric information.",
